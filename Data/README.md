# *Air Pollution among Californian Counties in 2024*

#### Air pollution can cause serious health risk, especially for vulnerable groups.Therefore we need to monitor and analyse it at a local state in order to take adequate protection measures. 

### Context

#### According to the American Lung Association, California is considered one of the states with the worst air pollution. But California is a large state, and the air pollution can vary greatly between different locations. Looking at the Air Quality Index of each individual county can give more insight of how the air pollution is spread across the state. Knowing where certain hotspots for bad air quality in California are, one can assure for adequate protection if possible, and further research can be done to implement solutions. 
#### The Air Quality Index is a measurement from the Environmental Protection Agency that categorizes the air quality in six different categories based on the amount of pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The six categories are 'Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups', 'Unhealthy', 'Very Unhealthy', and 'Hazardous'.
